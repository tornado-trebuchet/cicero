A cli/web tool for parliamentary speech analysis, data storage and representation.

Built with severe brain damage

TODO list (another one): 

1) Assemble the pipeline 
2) Make API queries to retrieve all the data in the period 
3) This means implementing a pipeline configuration 
4) Process and write everything 
4.1) This probably will require async 
5) Add parties 
6) Deduplicate parties if needed 
7) Test topic modelling 
8) Saturate all text fields: tokens, clean, translated

9) Implement CODER protocol for text marking with GUI 
10) Implement sentiment analysis 
11) Fit for export to DNA
